Posterno has been designed and coded to seamlessly integrate with any properly coded WordPress theme. Furthermore Posterno uses bootstrap 4 for styling all of the elements. However, each theme is coded differently and the quality of the code can vary. To avoid potential issues and conflicts, Posterno provides the ability to disable the built-in styling through the options panel. If your theme is properly coded, Posterno should adapt itself to your site layout. Although we cannot guarantee that the plugin works with all themes.
